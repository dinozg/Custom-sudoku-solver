**Title: Sudoku Solver**

**Description**

This Python project contains code for a Sudoku solver that utilizes basic rules and strategic deduction to find solutions to Sudoku puzzles. 
It leverages NumPy for efficient array manipulation.

**Features**

* **Initial Validity Check:** Ensures the provided Sudoku grid does not violate fundamental Sudoku rules (duplicate numbers within rows or columns).
* **Rule-based Solving:** Finds cells where only one possible number can be placed.
* **Sub-block Analysis:** Identifies unique solutions within 3x3 sub-blocks.
* **Row and Column Analysis:** Identifies unique solutions within individual rows and columns.

**Usage**

1. Install required dependencies: `numpy` (likely using `pip install numpy`)
2. Create a 9x9 NumPy array representing your Sudoku puzzle (0 for empty cells).
3. Call the `sudoku_solver` function, passing the NumPy array as input:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   from sudoku_solver import sudoku_solver  # Assuming your code is saved as sudoku_solver.py

   my_sudoku = np.array([
       # Your Sudoku puzzle here
   ])

   solved_sudoku = sudoku_solver(my_sudoku) 

   if np.all(solved_sudoku == -1):
       print("No solution found.")
   else:
       print(solved_sudoku) 
   ```

**Example**
```python
# Sample Sudoku puzzle 
puzzle = np.array([
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
])

solved_puzzle = sudoku_solver(puzzle)
print(solved_puzzle)
```

**Limitations**

* This solver may not be able to solve all Sudoku puzzles, especially those of higher difficulty.
* Currently, it does not employ advanced Sudoku techniques (e.g., X-Wing, Swordfish).
* It doesn't use backtracking algorithm.

**Future Development**

* Implement more advanced Sudoku solving techniques.
* Add a difficulty assessment function to categorize puzzles.
* Create a user-friendly interface (web or GUI).
